  As i've stated before Monster hunter (here on abbreviated as MH) is a game where you have to kill mosters, customize your hunter and collect the best weapons by killing and carving monster body parts.The game consists of various monsters(wyverns and dragons) which is your duty to kill.The most important type of "monsters" are wyverns, since these are the monsters you will be trying to kill the most. Wyverns are exactly like dragons but have only two legs.
 Some of these can be very difficult to overcome.This web page will give a description
of these various creatures and the items they have to offer.Oh yes,and before i forget,In MH you have Rankings which are called Hunter Rankings(Hr).The highest HR is 20 and the items and Monsters change when you turn from HR-12 to HR-13.You obtain HR by getting experience and you get Experience from completing Quests.</font></p>

        His major weakness is, you got it, Lightning!  Also remember
        that Sonic Bombs are your friend on a Plesioth since it'll
        get him out of the water.  Also Frogs are good to have to
        lure him out as well.  The sign that it is weakening is
        you will see its fin collapse.</p><p align = "right"><a href = "#123">Menu</a></p>
